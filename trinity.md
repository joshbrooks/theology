## Digging for Spiritual Gems, John 17:21-23

John 17:21 is included in a 2006 publication in Watchtower Library titled "Should You Believe in the Trinity?"
This is interesting to me as I have many friends and family who do believe in the Trinity - that is, that Jehovah, 
Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one (although most would not often use Jehovah's divine name).

One of the Bible verses or "Proof Texts" used to teach the doctrine of the Trinity is John 10:30 - "I and the Father are One".

John 17:21 can help us to show those who rely on the verse "I and the Father are One" to see that 
Jesus refers to the disciples "Being One" meaning not that they are the same, but that they are "In union",
meaning that together we seek to have unity and glorify Jehovah, and we can use this verse to show that in John 10:30 
Jesus is not claiming to be equal to or a part of God and to help them to see the unscriptural nature of the trinity
