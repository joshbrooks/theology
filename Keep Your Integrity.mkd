Our worship should be sound and whole.  
Integrity is wholehearted devotion to Jehovah. It means being without fault or blemish.

We are offended if what we buy has missing parts or is not as advertised.  
We also do not want to offend Jehovah by giving him something flawed.  
Therefore, We want to offer ourselves as a "perfect and pleasing" living sacrifice to God.

When we love someone we want them to be respected, honored and treated well.  
We would defend them if another person told a lie about their character.  
Because we love Jehovah, We want him to be honored.  
We want to show that He is honest and true.  
We do not want to believe or encourage Satan's lies about him.  
We want Him to be proven correct against Satan's challenges and lies.

4)Jehovah's forgiveness means that we can have integrity without being perfect

5. When we have love for Jehovah, He is first in our minds and we are determined not to do anything which would take away or diminish what is rightfully his - that is, ourt whole heart and soul and mind.
   Our love for Jehovah moves us to put Him first when we make decisions. We'll think "How would this make Jehovah feel" whenever we have a choice to make.

6. Our integrity show that we believe Jehovah God to be a good, just, generous and honest ruler. Adam and Eve did not have the love and integrity to Jehovah to show that.

7. Jehovah TRUSTED. Satan TESTED.

8. Satan caused terrible damage to Job by taking his family, posessions, and reputation.

9. While Job did not always act perfectly, he NEVER turned against Jehovah , never gave in, nad never gave away his integrity.

10. Satan has made the same challenge to use that he did to Job, namely, that under pressure or temptation we would all turn away from Jehovah.

11. Job's example shows that it is possible to keep integrity under extreme stress, and shows us good ways in which we can strengthen our integrity.

12. Job examined Jehovah's creation and by creation he recognised the power and wisdom of Jehovah. We have access to a greater understanding of the world around us than Job did and from the intricate details of the smallest cells to the incredible display of power in the stars and planets, we can see and gain an appreciation for Jehovah's fine works.

13. Job was careful to obey God in every aspect of his life

14. Job's example can also help us to keep a balanced view of material things.

15. Job knew that his integrity was not in vain. We can see how Jehovah rewarded Job's integrity and it can help us to keep our own integrity.

16. We need to resolve not to let go of integrity under any circumstances including threats of death.
