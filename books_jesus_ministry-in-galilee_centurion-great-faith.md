### Why do Jews plead on behalf of a Gentile army officer?

Many Jewish people resented being under Roman rule, perhaps because they felt that Rome was limiting their freedom and too harsh as leaders. From this passage we can see though that there were certainly some among the Romans who showed kindness towards the Jewish people in the areas they controlled, and here a Roman centurion has even asked the Jewish elders to talk to Jesus on his behalf to save his servant. They explain to Jesus that he "Loves our nation and he himself built our synagogue".

### What may explain why the centurion has not asked Jesus to enter his house?

This Centurion has already shown a deep respect for Jewish beliefs and customs, as shown by his contribution to building their synagogue. He might have learned about some of their beliefs. 

In Acts 10:28 Peter faces a very similar situation where another Roman officer is inspired in a vision to invite Peter to his house, and tells the people assembled there that is is unlawful for a Jew to "associate with or approach" any non Jewish person.

The centurion who asks Jesus for help may well have known that Jewish people would try to keep themselves free from involvement with other races for reasons of spiritual purity. It may have been his understanding and respect for Jewish customs and belief that explains why he said that Jesus did not need to enter his house.

### What prospect for Gentiles does Jesus highlight?

Before Jesus' ministry began, there are some people from other nations who join the Jewish nation, such as Rahab who helped Joshua and Caleb in the promised land and Ruth, who stayed with her mother-in-law to return to Israel.

Here Jesus extends that blessing, using the healing of this man and the faith of the centurion to show that many people from outside of Abraham's physical descendants will join "the Kingdom of the Heavens".

Study notes Matthew 8:5-13

 - "My servant" (greek) is a term with some affection attached
 - "Many from east and west" indicated that non-Jews would have a part in the Kingdom
 - "Recline at the table" indicates a close personal fellowship
