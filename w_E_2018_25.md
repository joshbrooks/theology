## John 7-8

v 1. "The Jews" - context here refers to the Jewish authorities - religious leaders
v 11. "The Jews" - context here may refer to people in general
v 1,11,13,15: In different contexts, John's use of "The Jews" may refer to *either* Jewish people in general *or* religious leaders

v 39."For there was as yet no spirit" might be taken to mean that prior to Pentecost, the Spirit (which certainly had come as evidenced by Judges) was present in a diffent way. The Spirit had not yet come in the dramatic form of Pentecost.

## Diggging for Spiritual Gems"

John 7:8-10

Reference: The Watchtower 2007 02 01

Did Jesus lie (that is, intentionally deceive) his brothers?

Jesus did not lie to his spiritual brothers. He told them he would "not yet" be going to the festival. He did not intend to draw attention to himself. What he said was not untrue; it was an answer which limited the possible harm which might be done to him, his followers, or his ministry in Jerusalem at that time.


John 8:58

This is one verse which has been interpreted to give support to the idea that Jesus claimed to be the same person as God.
The argument is over the rendering of a Greek phrase 'ego eimi'. 
Many of us here have encountered the challenge involved in translating and how important it is to consider the context.
That is, when we translate, we cannot take one word in Greek and say that this word can always be translated into that word in English or Indonesia. 
There's the order of words, tense, gender, and a number of other factors to consider when we're making a translation. 

Here the issue is how to translate a simple phrase in Greek - 'ego eimi'.
The Septuagint, which is the translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek, uses this phrase for Jehovah's words in Exodus 3:14 where in English the best translation might be "I AM".

Why then would our New World Translation use a different phrase here - "Have Been"?
Well, we have two strong arguments to use the words "Have Been" instead of the words "I Am"

 - First - in other places in the Greek Scriptures where this phrase occurs many translations use the most appropriate phrase "Have Been"
 - Second - We know from other scriptures that Jesus did not reason himself to be the same person as the Father.

## Living as Christians

### Demonstrate Christlike Humility and Modesty


1) "I think I've been extra busy"

Bragging about being in the Circuit Overseer program.
"Come to think of it guys, I *am* the part"

2) Alex first gave credit to Jehovah and focussed on the woek they did together
When given a clear opportunity to brag about his involvement he simply said he would be "tied up"

3) Brother Harris
Failed to demonstrate modesty by claiming the right to make a decision without referring to the body of elders.

4) Brother Harris "Will check with the other elders and discuss it". Gives credit to the theocratic arrangement.
