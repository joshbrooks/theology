["Jeová hafolin ninia atan sira neʼebé haraik an", tdt](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dsync/r1/lp-e/r71/lp-ttp/2019560)


1. Jeova hadomi ema ne'ebd haraik ain. Salmo 138 esplika Jeova mak "dook husi ema neebe loko an". Baihira ami estuda Biblia, ami mos aprende kona ba Jeova nia belun sira hanesan Moises, Numbers 12:3 esplika "Moises mak ema ne'eebe laran-maus liu fali ema seluk".

2. Iha lisaun nee ami sei koalia kona ba pergunta tolu
(1) Haraik an katak sá?
(2) Tanbasá ita presiza haburas hahalok haraik an?
(3) Situasaun saida deʼit mak bele koko ita-nia haraik an?

Ita mos sei haree benefisui sira ami hetan liuhusi hahalok haraik.

3. Haraik an book Jeova nia atan atu hanoin fali ema hotu iha esperiensia ka kbiit ka qualidade ka buat seluk neebe nia la iha, entaun nia la bele hanoin nia mak ema neebe diak liu ema seluk naran deit.

4. Haraik an mak qualidade ami hotu presiza kontinua hametin, laos buat ami aprende liuhusi kultura ka bainhira ami sai boot. Luke 6:45 esplika ema neebe aat labele subar ninia aat tanba buat nia ibun sei dehan mai husi ninia laran.

6. Maski Paulo serbisu iha kota no kongragasaun barak tebes, nia kontinua koalia ho haraik an nomos sempre hanoin fali nia sussesu mai liuhusi Jeova nia domin no laran-diak deit.

7. Ema neebe iha knaar importante mos bele hatudu haraik an baihira nia la haluha nia mos ema fraku, no simu konsellu ho laran diak.

8. How does [1 Peter 5:6](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/b/r1/lp-e/nwtsty/E/2019/60/5#v=60:5:6) help us to see that humility pleases Jehovah?

    > 1 Peter 5:6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time


    1 Peter 5:6 as well as the way Jehovah dealt with people who were arrogant help us to see that Jehovah is not pleased by the haughty, but by people of humility. One outstanding  example of a person who failed to show humility and the consequences because of it is the man Korah, who tried to claim leadership of the people of Israel over Moses.


9. How does humility draw other people to us?

Spending time with a person with humility is refreshing, not tiring.

10. How does humility make our life easier?

When we are humble we are more likely to accept difficult circumstances and remain positive.

11. (How should we react when we receive counsel?)
(Tanbasá mak ita presiza haraik an kuandu hetan konsellu?)

Delabarak, ami hotu lakohi simu konsellu! Maibee haraik an bele aduda hau simu konsellu, nomos ajuda hau atu la estraga relasaun ho Jeova no ema neebe ajuda hau liuhusi konsellu.

12. (According to Proverbs 27:5, 6, why should we appreciate someone who offers us counsel? Illustrate.)

13. (How can we show humility when others receive privileges of service?)
We should rejoice when we see others reaching out _alongside_ us.

Paul explains that we are all in this "race", but we should remember that in this case we run as a team. Each of us has opportunities now, and will have opportunities in the future, to serve. Perhaps when I remember that, I'll be able to rejoice in the responsibilities which my brothers and sisters receive!

Ema hotu iha opportunidade ona nomos sei hetan opportinidade seluk atu serbi hamutuk iha Jeova nia organizasaun sei ami kontinua lao ho Jeova. Haraik an sei ajuda hau sente kontente bainhira hau nia irman-irmaun sire hetan knaar foun!

14. Moses' humility led him to ask his experienced father-in-law and others in the congregation to help him to lead the people, even though it was to Moses that Jehovah had given the primary responsibility.

Moises nia haraik an book nia atu husu Jethro no ema seluk nebee iha maduru atu ajuda nia bainhira nia presiza dirije povu Izrael, maski Jeova rasik fo knaar ba nia.

15. Age, health problems, family, and peronal circumstances may oblige us to make changes to our assignments.

    Idade, Saude, Familia sira nia problema, no seluk tan bele obriga ami atu troka knaar.

16. Love and humility helps brothers and sisters who have to change assignments to realize that Jehovah's organisation still has very valuable work for them to do, and that remaining dedicated to Jehovah rather than to a job or title will bring them job and peace no matter what their assignment becomes.

Domin no haraik an ajuda irman-irmaun sira neebe presize troka ninia knaar atu hatene Jeova ni organizasaun sei iha serbisu neebe iha folin boot, nomos nia bele kontinua hetan dame no kontente sei nia kontinua serbi Jeova rasik duke serbi tanba nia iha posizaun ka knaar ruma.

17. Humility helps us to have good relationships with brothers and sisters and most importantly with Jehovah.

Haraik an ajuda ami atu iha relasaun diak ho irman-irmaun sira no, importante tebes, ho Jeova.

What is humility?

Humility is a quality which Moses and many of our brothers and sisters display by thinking highly of others, and continuing to respect the skills, advice, and assignments which others may receive.

Haraik an iha qualidade neebe Moises nomos ami nia irman-irmaun barak hatudu liuhusi hanoin ema seluk duke ninia an rasik, no nia kontinua hatudu respeitu ba ema seluk nia abilidade, ajuda neebe nia simu husi ema seluk, no knaar neebe ema seluk simu.

Why should we cultivate humility?

Humility helps us to build close relatinoships within our congragation, organisation, and worldwide. It reduces friction and helps us to walk together in love. Most importantly it helps us to act in a way which Jehovah loves and values, for he is near to those who are humble.

Haraik an ajuda ita atu hametin relasaun diak ho irma-irmaun sira iha kongragasaun, organizasaun, no mundu tomak. Nia ajuda ita atu kontinua lao hamutuk ho domin. Nomos importante liu haraik an book ita atu halo buat naran deit iha dalan neebe Jeova hadomi no hafolin, tanba nia besik ema neebe iha haraik an.

What situations can test our humility?

Changes in assignment and receiving counsel might test our ability to remain humble.
