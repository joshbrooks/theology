[Saducees ask Jesus about the Resurrection](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/w20140815/jesus-sadducees-marriage-after-resurrection/)

Our talk tonight is about Jesus' reply to the Sadduces who asked him which man a woman who had been married seven times would be married to in the resurrection.
Please open your Bible with me to Luke 20:34

> 34  Jesus said to them: “The children of this system of things marry and are given in marriage, 35  but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.a 36  In fact, neither can they die anymore, for they are like the angels, and they are God’s children by being children of the resurrection.

## Jesus' comments about 'Resurrection' Concern us all
- Q asked in Watchtower 2014
- Especially important to many brothers and sisters who were married and are now separated by death
   - Marriage is a provision from Jehovah
   - The first book of the Bible contains the words
  > 2:23  Then the man said:
  > “This is at last bone of my bones
  > And flesh of my flesh.
   - So we are expecially interested in finding out what happens to this very special relationship after we or one whom we love falls asleep

## The Saducees were not asking for the same reasons we would ask this question

 - The Saducees took a very caring, loving provision from the Mosaic Law to trap Jesus with a question about resurrection
 - They did not believe in the resurrection anyhow!
> Acts 23:8 "For the Sadducees say that there is neither resurrection nor angel nor spirit..."

 - We are glad to have a more accurate knowledge revealed to us by the complete Word of God
 - Base of question was the provision in Deuteronomy 25:5 of Brother-in-law marriage, where a widow's brother-in-law should marry her
 - The comfort that the deceased one's portion of the promised land would be passed on to his children
 - The family line continues, the widow is be provided for
 - You may recall Ruth's story, where this principle applied: there was a relative who had the right and responsibility to provide for her
 - The Sadducees did not ask out of concern for a widow such as Ruth - they asked it to trap Jesus

## We have a different point of view! We might gain more than the Saducees would have...

 - We want to examine what Jesus's word means in this paragraph
   - Which of the "resurrections" is Jesus referring to? Will this situation of "not marrying or being given in marriage" affect the relationships we have now, when we experience the earthly resurrection?
   - A lot of publications assume or conclude that it is the Earthly resurrection
   - When we look closely at this material and passages connected, we might change our understanding
   - Jesus tells us to meditate on His word! And that His message is for the humble of heart.

## Jesus' words in light of the whole Word of God

Does Jesus refer here to earthly or heavenly resurrection?
It could be that he was referring to the resurrection of the anointed

Jesus refers here to 'Those who have been counted worthy of gaining . . . the resurrection from the dead.'
It could be that he is referring to faithful *anointed* ones
Not every person resurrected to earth could be described as being "counted worthy" - some who will experience the earthly resurrection are described as being "unrighteous".

> Acts 25:15  And I have hope toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

Jesus' words may also indicate that death has no power over those anointed ones which would also be consistent with Jesus referring to the heaveny resurrection. 
 
 - Jesus may have meant Heavenly resurrection, but we cannot be sure
 
  - His answer may have been intended for disciples - not for his opposers
  - Questions still remain - what of those who remarry? What of those who are resurrected to Heaven?
  - Is there anything we can come away with from the passage?
  - If Jesus was, in fact, talking about the heavenly resurrection, then his words aren't intended to tell us on whether resurrected ones on earth will be able to marry in the new world.

 ## Encourage our brothers and sisters, especially in the light of this passage of scripture?
 - We may not be sure of how our relationships would be formed in the new world, but we can be sure that
 - Jehovah will satisfy all their needs and desires in the best possible way.—Ps. 145:16.
> 16  You open your hand And satisfy the desire of every living thing.

## Promise from Psalm 145:16
We might wish that we had more details of the resurrection, and more answered questions! 
But what does Psalm 145:16 assure us of?
*Jehovah generously satisfies the desires of every living thing* in the new world. 
 - From our God, the One True God who is good, loving and true.
 - For us all - including married, single, those who have lost loved ones, and those who have already fallen asleep.
 - It may not be in the way we hope or expect
 - That's a promise which encourages us and which we can use to encourage others in difficult situations
 - That's a promise we will see fulfilled in the new world

### Conclusion? 
 - Thanks to Jehovah for confidence in the resurrection
 - Continue to find joy and peace in assurance that we have His promises of salvation, eternal life, joy, and satisfaction through His kingdom rule
