[Saducees ask Jesus about the Resurrection](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/w20140815/jesus-sadducees-marriage-after-resurrection/)

## Our interest in this passage is because it concerns all of us
 - Especially important to many brothers and sisters who desire to be reunited with *a loved one who has fallen asleep* and experience a *continuing special relationship* with them
   - Marriage is a provision from Jehovah
   - The first book of the Bible contains the words
   - "Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh"
   - So we are expecially interested in finding out what happens to this very special relationship after we or one whom we love falls asleep

## The Saducees were not asking for the same reasons we would ask this question

 - The Saducees took a very caring, loving provision from the Mosaic Law to trap Jesus with a question about resurrection for a trap
   - They did not believe in the resurrection anyhow! 
> Acts 23:8 "For the Sadducees say that there is neither resurrection nor angel nor spirit..."

 - We are glad to have a more accurate knowledge revealed to us by the complete Word of God
 - Base of question was the provision of Brother-in-law marriage
>Deuteronomy 25
> 5  “If brothers dwell together and one of them dies without having a son, the wife of the dead one should not marry someone from outside the family. Her brother-in-law should go to her, take her as his wife, and perform brother-in-law marriage with her. 6  The firstborn whom she will bear will carry on the name of his dead brother,g so that his name may not be wiped out of Israel.
   - The comfort that the deceased one's portion of the promised land would be passed on to his children
   - Would ensure that the family line continued and that the widow would be provided for
   - Example: in Ruth's time when the "closer relative" did not marry her
> Ruth 4:10 
> 10  I am also acquiring Ruth the Moʹab·i·tess, the wife of Mahʹlon, as a wife to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance, so that the name of the dead man will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the city gate of his home. You are witnesses today.”

The Sadducees did not ask out of concern for a widow such as Ruth - they asked it to trap Jesus

## We have a different point of view! We might gain more than the Saducees would have...

 - We want to examine what Jehovah's word means in this paragraph
   - Which of the "resurrections" is Jesus referring to? Will this situation of "not marrying or being given in marriage" affect the relationships we have now, when we experience the earthly resurrection?
   - Previous published material has indicated that it is the Earthly resurrection
   - When we look closely at this material and passages connected, we might change our understanding
   - Jesus tells us to meditate on His word! And that His message is for the humble of heart.

## Jesus' words in light of the whole Word of God

Does Jesus refer here to earthly or heavenly resurrection?
It could be that he was referring to the resurrection of the anointed

Jesus refers here to 'Those who have been counted worthy of gaining . . . the resurrection from the dead.'
It could be that he is referring to faithful *anointed* ones
Not every person resurrected to earth could be described as being "counted worthy" - some who will experience the earthly resurrection are described as being "unrighteous".

> Acts 25:15  And I have hope toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

Jesus' words may also indicate that death has no power over those anointed ones which would also be consistent with Jesus referring to the heaveny resurrection. 
 
 - Jesus may have meant Heavenly resurrection, but we cannot be sure
 
  - His answer may have been intended for disciples - not for his opposers
  - Questions still remain - what of those who remarry? What of those who are ressurected to Heaven?
  - Is there anything we can come away with from the passage?
  - If Jesus was, in fact, talking about the heavenly resurrection, then his words do not shed any light on whether resurrected ones on earth will be able to marry in the new world.

 ## So what can we use to encourage our brothers and sisters, especially in the light of this passage of scripture?

 But of this we can be sure: Obedient humans will be happy, for Jehovah will satisfy all their needs and desires in the best possible way.—Ps. 145:16.
