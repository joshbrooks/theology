# Saducees ask Jesus about the Resurrection


## This passage means a lot to Christian believers

 - This is especially important to many brothers and sisters who desire to be reunited with a loved one who is asleep and experience a continuing special relationship with them
   - Marriage is a provision from Jehovah
   - "Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh"

## The Saducees used this situation as a trap for Jesus

 - The Saducees took a very caring, loving provision from the Mosaic Law to trap Jesus with a question about resurrection
   - They did not believe in the resurrection anyhow! 
     - Their belief seems to be that after death, we cease to exist
     - We might ask, what the point of life for a Saducee? We are glad to have a more accurate knowledge revealed to us by the complete Word of God
   - Base of question was the provision of Brother-in-law marriage
   - Intent: to provide "that a family would continue" - an heir for the one who passed away
     - The comfort that the deceased one's portion of the promised land would be passed on to his children
   - Would ensure that the family line continued and that the widow would be provided for
   - Example: in Ruth's time when the "closer relative" did not marry her

## We have a different point of view! We might gain more than the Saducees would have...

 - We want to examine what Jehovah's word means in this paragraph
   - Which of the "resurrections" is Jesus referring to?
   - Previous published material has indicated that it is the Earthly resurrection
   - When we look closely at this material and passages connected, we might change our understanding
   - Jesus tells us to meditate on His word! And that His message is for the humble of heart.

## Jesus' words in light of the whole Word of God

Discuss what these two sentences mean:
 "Those who have been counted worthy" seems to connect to "worthy of the Kingdom of God"
 "Neither can they die any more" 
 
 Conclude that Jesus may have meant Heavenly resurrection, but we cannot be sure
 
  - His answer may have been intended for disciples - not for his opposers
  - Questions still remain - what of those who remarry? What of those who are ressurected to Heaven?
  - Is there anything we can come away with from the passage?

## We have a beautiful hope in the future, whatever the case

 Finale: We can be confident in any case that Jehovah has His people's desires and needs covered
 " We live on this earth sadly separated from Jehovah by sin"
 " We live in this system of things with the sadness of knowing that all of us will experience a separation from the ones we love by death, 
 and that ones we love might be saddened some day when we fall asleep, 
 but we retain this beautiful promise from our loving God Jehovah of a resurrection to eternal life with Him!"
 
 ## How can we encourage brothers and sisters who may feel distressed by the prospect of not being sure?


 So what can we use to encourage our brothers and sisters, especially in the light of this passage of scripture?
 
  - Jesus answer tells us a little about the resurrection, but most importantly that it is real
  - Reaffirms for us that Our future selves will experience a more complete life than even the best life we can imagine here in this system
  - We can take heart from the example of the apostle Paul - nearing the end of his own earthly course, feeling the signs and pains of
 age, he was saddened that he was unable to enjoy the freedom and the relationships he had once had with his followers.
  - He knew all of his earthly connections might soon end but he remained positive and joyful that he would soon experience a NEW existence - "To die is Christ" he said. 

  - Let us not be discouraged by what we might lose in this life in death, but let's look forward with joy to an existence where we experience Fully the peace, joy and fellowship we have a small taste of in this life, and which some brothers and sisters experience in the special relationship of marriage. 
 
  *Jehovah will fulfill our needs and our desires!*
